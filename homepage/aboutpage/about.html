            I am 24 years old and about to finish my time here at Cal State Fullerton University. I had no experience with coding prior of attending my school, I actaully had sights of becoming a Civil Engineer with creating some schematics during my high school days. 
            I have a couple of projects under my belt and somehow, I ended up getting my bachelor's in Computer Science. I was able to learn varies things such as colaboarting with others on software projects, as well as adpoting a new way of thinking with coding my invovled in my life. I am currently employed at Panada Express, where I adapted of having strong work ethic and values of working in a team. For my free time, I do enjoy playing competeitive shooters, and going on my daily runs in the morning. After finishing college, I wish to get into Data analytics in my future career.</h2>
